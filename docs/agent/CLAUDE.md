# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Git Commit Rules

1. Keep commit titles under 50 characters, using imperative tense (e.g., "add fix" not "added fix")
2. Use Conventional Commits format: `<type>(scope): <subject>`
   - feat: new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - docs: documentation
   - refactor: code change that doesn't fix bugs or add features
   - chore: build/tooling changes
   - `scope` is the functional area touched (`docs`, `domain`, `dal`, `vault`, `node`, …) — never the repo name itself (no `(core)` in dpp-core, no `(engine)` in dpp-engine), since a repo's own history is already scoped to that repo
3. NEVER include `Co-Authored-By` or any AI attribution tags in commit messages
4. NEVER commit or push code without approval
5. NEVER commit before running the full check suite (`just check`) locally and confirming it is green — a commit is not ready because the code looks right, it is ready because the same gate CI runs has already passed
6. Do not reference internal planning taxonomy (roadmap phase letters, review chunk numbers, priority tags like N-1/P0/R-phase) in commit messages or in code/doc comments outside the planning docs themselves — describe what the change does, not which internal tracking item it closes

## Overview

**dpp-core** is the pure, stateless core library for the Odal Node Digital Product Passport system. It contains domain types, cryptographic primitives, schema validation, and port traits — all publishable under Apache-2.0. No database, no HTTP framework, no infrastructure dependencies.

**The Golden Rule**: If code changes because an EU regulation changed → it belongs here.

**The Compilation Test**: `cargo build --workspace` must succeed with zero infrastructure running — no DB, no Redis, no env vars.

## Crate Layout

```
dpp-domain        — domain types, port traits, VersionedSchemaRegistry, JSON Schema validation
dpp-crypto        — Ed25519 key management, AES-GCM, JWS sign/verify, did:web DID builder, LocalIdentityService
dpp-digital-link  — GS1 Digital Link parser (pure, no I/O)
dpp-plugin-traits — Wasm plugin host/guest contract: DppSectorPlugin trait, capabilities, AbiResult
dpp-plugin-sdk    — guest-side SDK: export_plugin! macro (generates the ABI incl. describe()) + Validator
dpp-registry      — EU Central Registry interface types (wasm32-safe)
dpp-rules         — pure no_std, zero-dep cross-field regulatory rules; shared by dpp-domain and the Wasm plugins (kept separate by design — target per-sector structure in docs/architecture/SECTOR-MODEL-CONSOLIDATION.md §7)
dpp-calc          — EU-methodology calculators (CO2e cradle-to-gate, EN 45554 repairability); pure, stateless; licensed LCI data injected via FactorProvider, never bundled
dpp-tests         — cross-crate integration tests (textile E2E, transfer of responsibility, access tiers, schema conformity)
```

Sector plugins (`plugins/sector-*`) are standalone Rust crates compiled to `wasm32-wasip1`, excluded from the workspace. Each implements `DppSectorPlugin` and calls `export_plugin!` once; **`sector-battery` is the reference implementation**. The host calls a plugin's `describe()` export and runs `check_compatibility` before dispatch. See `docs/architecture/PLUGIN-HOST.md`.

## Build and Development Commands

```sh
just check          # Full gate: fmt-check → lint → test → audit
just build          # Release build for all workspace crates
just build-plugins  # Compile Wasm sector plugins (wasm32-wasip1)
just test           # cargo nextest run --workspace
just lint           # cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
just fmt            # cargo fmt --all
just clean          # cargo clean
```

## Architecture

### Port Traits (dpp-domain::ports)

Port traits define the core/platform boundary:
- `PassportRepository` (async, persistence)
- `ComplianceRegistry` + `ComplianceStrategy` (non-async, sector dispatch)
- `IdentityPort` (async, sign/verify)
- `PluginHost` (non-async, Wasm dispatch)
- `ArchivePort` (async, immutable archival with retention guarantees)
- `RegistrySyncPort` (async, EU Central Registry registration/status sync)
- `SealPort` (async, eIDAS qualified electronic seal — ESPR Art. 13 / eIDAS 910/2014)

All implementations live in the platform repo.

### Schemas

Versioned JSON schemas at `crates/dpp-domain/schemas/{sector}/v{version}.json` (inside the crate so they ship on publish). The `VersionedSchemaRegistry` in dpp-domain embeds them via `include_str!()` and validates passport data at runtime. Adding a new schema version is a single file addition. **Never** `include_str!` a path outside the crate dir — `cargo publish` excludes it and the crate fails to build for downstream consumers.

### Wasm Targets

- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` — `dpp-registry` (EU registry types) and `dpp-digital-link`
- `wasm32-wasip1` — sector plugins (wasmtime host in platform)

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.
